The Smart Office System is a console-based application that manages conference room bookings, occupancy detection, and automated control of air conditioning and lighting based on room usage. It leverages key design patterns such as the Singleton Pattern to ensure a single instance of the office configuration, the Observer Pattern to manage room occupancy and automate lighting and AC systems, and the Command Pattern to handle room booking and cancellation commands. This project demonstrates how design patterns can be applied to create a scalable, maintainable system for smart office management, emphasizing SOLID principles and best practices.
