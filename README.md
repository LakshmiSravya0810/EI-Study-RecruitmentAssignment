EI-STUDY Recruitment Assigment


This repository contains the implementation of two exercises focusing on design patterns and best practices in Java. Exercise 1 demonstrates six use cases involving Behavioral, Creational, and Structural design patterns, including Observer, Command, Singleton, Factory, Adapter, and Decorator. Exercise 2 is a Smart Office System that uses the Singleton, Observer, and Command patterns to manage room bookings, occupancy, and automated control systems. Both exercises follow SOLID principles and showcase scalable, maintainable solutions.
